1. # Forum System (Spring Boot + Redis + Kafka)

  A basic yet fully functional forum backend system, developed using Spring Boot. This project supports secure user authentication, interactive user features (posts, comments, likes, follows), caching strategies with Redis, asynchronous messaging with Kafka and global search with Elasticsearch.

  ## üîß Core Functionalities

  1. **Login State Management**  
     - Tracks user login status using interceptors and session persistence.
     - Solves statelessness in HTTP by binding login context.
     - Protects access to sensitive resources for logged-in users only.

  2. **Hot Data Caching**  
     - Stores frequently queried data (e.g., user profiles) in Redis to reduce DB stress.
     - Improves system performance and response time.

  3. **Cache Consistency Strategy**  
     - Handles cache invalidation on updates (e.g., follow/unfollow).
     - Uses a transactional pattern: *update DB ‚Üí delete cache*, ensuring consistency.

  4. **Asynchronous Messaging with Kafka**  
     - Decouples logic for system notifications (likes, follows, comments).
     - Pushes events to Kafka queues and processes them asynchronously.
     - Reduces blocking during peak interaction times.
